Project Overview: Family Tracking

The name of my application is Family Tracking (F-Tracking). 
If tracking the location of people whom you love sounds shady or you are worry about spying, stalking, you should try my app. 
Family Tracking is an app that can passively monitor the whereabouts of friends and family members and it's a great relief. 
No more worrying when someone forgets to call, be held, or be lost. 
A quick glance at your tracking app tells you all you need to know - and then you can relax. 
F-Tracking also lets you share real-time locations, estimated arrival times, and travel speeds through email, text, or social networks.
